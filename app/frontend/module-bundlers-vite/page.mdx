# Module bundlers: Vite

In <a style={{ textDecoration: "underline"}}href={'/frontend/module-bundlers-webpack'}>this</a> blog post I explained what are module
bundlers and why we need them.

## Introduction

To create a simple website we need three things: html file, css to make the html pretty and finally the js file with logic.
So why do we need some like webpack or vite?

```js filename="index.js" {3} copy
import { a } from '

console.log(a);
```

Importing causes an error
