# Module bundlers: Webpack and Vite

Nowadays you can't do frontend web development professionaly without using a module bundler. Why do we need them and what is their purpose?

## Introduction

To create a simple website we need three things: html file, css to make the html pretty and finally the js file with logic.
So why do we need some like webpack or vite?

```js filename="demo.js" {3} copy
let a = 1;

console.log(a);
```
